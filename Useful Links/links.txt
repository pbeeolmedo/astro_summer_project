Using SEGUE and CASJobs
This page describes the SEGUE data available in the DR8 CAS database, and how to access this
data using queries composed in the SQL language. If you would like to access the data using some
other system, please go to the Data Access for SDSS DR8 page.

SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP)
SDSS/SEGUE stellar spectra are processed through the SEGUE Stellar Parameter
Pipeline (SSPP), and three primary stellar parameters, effective temperature (Teff),
surface gravity (log g), and metallicity ([Fe/H]) are reported for most stars in the
temperature range 4000 - 10,000 K and with spectral S/N ratios exceeding 10/1.
